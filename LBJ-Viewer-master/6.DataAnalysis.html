<h1>Data Analysis </h1>
<h2>6.1 Generate an OLAP Report</h2>
<p>This module will be used by the system administrator to generate and display an <span class="code">OLAP</span> report according to admin specified values. </p>

<p>This page is reached when an admin clicks on the <span class="code">Analysis</span> button from the profile page </p>
<p>If the user is not a system administrator then clicking the button will not do anything and the user will be redirected back to the profile page.</p>
<p>The admin may then choose to display the number of images for:</p>
<ul>
<li> <span class="code">an owner</span>, <span class="code">a subject</span>, <span class="code">or time period</span>.</li>
<li> A administrator may also perform a drill down or roll up according to a time hierarchy (yearly, monthly, or weekly).</li>
</ul>
<p> A system administrator is also able to perform a query on any combination of these as long as a value is entered and the
  sort checkbox for that value is checked to let our program know. </p>
<p> If no value is entered then a query for count of all images in the system will be retrieved. </p>
<p> When admin wishes to query for a subject or a user they must also check the <span class="code">Search for x</span> box corresponding to that value. </p>
<p>Clicking the <span class="code">Run</span> button will perform our test and an analysis report will be generated according to the values specified. </p>
